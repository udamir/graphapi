  scalars:
    ID:
      title: ID
      description: >-
        The `ID` scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to
        refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON
        response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable.
        When expected as an input type, any string (such as `"4"`) or integer
        (such as `4`) input value will be accepted as an ID.
      type: string
    String:
      title: String
      description: >-
        The `String` scalar type represents textual data, represented as UTF-8
        character sequences. The String type is most often used by GraphQL to
        represent free-form human-readable text.
